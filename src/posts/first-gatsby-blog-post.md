Hello. My name is Nur Nadiah binti Abas and I am currently in my 3rd year of taking major in Web Development in one of the colleges in Brunei Darussalam. 


I started taking Information Technology from Skill Certificate 3 level in one of the colleges in Brunei Darussalam back in 2013. I began to have more interest in this course and explored more into it. In 2014, I continued taking diploma in Information Technology at the same college. In that year, I learned more details about Information Technology in general. I’ve learned few computer languages and I scored Distinction in Database system. My interest is more into designing the websites as well as in database. I have been keeping my dream to make my own website from scratch and make all it works perfectly and launch it in the Internet. I managed to complete my diploma and was not thinking of pursuing to the next level but I still tried to apply and luckily managed to get in.
